This is a quick and dirty Python script that I use to create LaTeX files. Here are the options:

There's multiple commands that you need to execute to convert an TEX file into a PDF file
(and there's more if you include a BibTex file), and this Python script handles all of them.

$ lt.py -h
Usage: lt.py [options] [latex file]

This program is used to convert LaTeX documents into PDF documents.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --show            Show the completed PDF.
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose. Print what is going on.
  -C, --noclean         Delete intermediate files if typesetting successful.
  -p PAPERSIZE, --papersize=PAPERSIZE
                        Desired papersize handled by dvipdfm. Uses 'letter' by
                        default.

This program assumes that the following files are already installed and configured on your computer:

latex   - Used to convert a TEX file into a DVI file
dvipdfm - Used to convert a DVI file into a PDF file
bibtex  - Used to incoperate a BIB file (for your document's sources) into the DVI file made by LaTeX
evince  - Used to display PDFs. Standard program on Linux distros.
